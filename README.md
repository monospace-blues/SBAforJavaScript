Website
https://monospace-blues.github.io/SBAforJavaScript/

This is a barebones website that is supposed to act like a simple social media site. You can click on the post title and go to a another webpage where you can comment. It also has an about page (really simple and not much going on).

Uses a function where when you select a post, it saves the info of the post to localStorage and is then pulled for the next page and plugged into their respective tags.

When you type the comments it checks if it's an email and if it's not you get an alert (you should still be able to type in whatever name).
